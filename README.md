This site is a photo gallery made with Jekyll, a static site generator, and hosted with Github Pages.

Jekyll uses its _posts folder to populate the content of the blog. Similarly, within our structure, each file in _posts represents a set of images. Each image set is defined in the Jekyll front matter of the file (the stuff in between the `---`).

Each image is composed of three things: a title (`title`), a thumbnail (`thumbnail`), and a set of images. The thumbnail appears in the grid on the homepage. When the thumbnail is clicked, the site redirects to the page for each individual post. The title appears above the set of images.
